THE ShipWeightOS PACKAGE
========================

ShipWeightOS is an open-source ship weights tracking program written
in the Python programming language.  It is intended to be an
alternative to currently existing ship-weight tracking and estimating
software that is either not user-friendly or was built with archaic
programming languages and has not been (adequately) updated.


SETUP
=====

 1. Install Python if not already locally installed
 
 2. ...to be continued.
 

ABOUT THE CODE
==============

The code is purposefully structured in a minimalist style.  It only
contains the attributes, functions, and methods that are already
present in other ship-weight tracking and estimating programs.  More
documentation will be developed in parallel to the development
of the code.
